# Redux Rounding Out

## "Ducks" Pattern

* A recommended way of organizing files for redux

## "Loading" pattern

* A pattern for writing action types in the format: loading, received, error

## "Selectors" pattern

* A pattern for writing small functions to compute "derived" data

## "withExtraArgument" feature of redux-thunk

* That gives...well, extra arguments to thunks
* This makes them crazy easy to test :)

# Reflections

- JavaScript library
- ...For building user interfaces
- Uses components
- Stateful and stateless components
- Allows reusing components
- "Virtual DOM"
- AJAX requests
  - you use these with single page apps to get data, so that you can update the view with that data
- Uses JSX
  - Webpack compiles/transpiles JSX into regular, browser-friendly JS
    - compilation: turns human-readable source code into non-human readable machine code
    - transpilation: turns human-readable source code into possibly still readable source code (but not necessarily as easy to read)
- Made by/supported by Facebook

# Questions

* How to do that default data in the form thing
* When using JSX, can you use any HTML5 stuff
  * Probably, look it up to be sure
* Do a "back" button
* Separating state from view === stayin' DRY
* Event handlers: "event" object

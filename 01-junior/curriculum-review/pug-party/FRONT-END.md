* When to wrap your component in `withRouter`
x Thunks and promises
x When to make new components
x Stateful v. stateless
  - Start stateless
  - If you need
    - state
    - a lifecycle hook
    - additional methods
      - then just refactor it to be a class
x When to manage something locally v. Redux state
  - "important", highly shareable, database-y state goes in the store
  - forms, quick color changes, unimporatnt, ephemeral: just use react
* Reasonable form validation

  * yes, but there still might be cases where you need more
